## Description

The Craver is a simple search application using restful API's to help you decide what to eat.  If you know what you want to eat, but are unsure if you want to cook or dine out, the craver will give you an assortment of recipes and nearby restaurants to satisfy your craving. This app is fully responsive to all screentypes and displays the lists on a clean colapsible style list.  It has a polished look for the landing page and makes deciding what to have for dinner easy!

## Way Ahead
 This project was completed to meet all grading requirements of the Front End Project for UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp.  It was accomplished during a two week sprint and was for most contributors our first time working as a team on a shared repository.  If this project was to have improvements made we would do the following: 
 * fix the message stating the restaurant type is not found after searching.
 * add gps capibility to find your location
 * add click to navigate functionality
 * show reviews for restaurants and recipes
